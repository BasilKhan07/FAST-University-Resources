Please Note
I have provided the code for filter and data source at the end of description. 
I skipped 3 filter in the video, now I have attached the code at the end if you are interested you can use below code, and see the working yourself.
Also Note: In YouTube Description, I cannot write "Greater than" or "Less than" sign, so add the greater than sign where I have written 'Add GreaterThan_sign here'
Also you can easily give colors to above card, I somehow forgot about them, so do that that yourself.

You guys can send me your version of this app in my mail address, also add some additional functionality
